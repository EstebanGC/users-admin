# ðŸŒ€ Django App

This is an app in Python using the Django framework to model tasks and authentication with tokens and MySQL.


## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a developer focused on backend with knowledge in Java with Spring Boot, Javascript with NodeJS and a little of NestJS and these last days (Feb/2023) in Python with Django.


## ðŸ”¥ Running the project 

To run the project, first you need to install Python and Django. Once you have Python, type this on the terminal:

```bash
  pip install django
```

With Django already installed it's time to run the project: 

```bash
  python manage.py runserver
```

Now, you have everything setted up to run the project. Enjoy it!
